## Infrastructure

### Supabase (primary data store)
- URL: `https://vzozyzkaovegwfdmbcxg.supabase.co`
- Credentials: `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Key tables: `bookings`, `properties`, `property_owners`, `owners`, `booking_charges`, `pricing_snapshots`, `market_data_cache`, `seasonal_price_floors`
- Booking sync: runs every 3 hours via pg_cron → Edge Function `sync-bookings`
- 1,301 bookings loaded, going back to June 2019

### Supabase REST API pattern
```javascript
const url = process.env.SUPABASE_URL;  // or read from settings.json
const key = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY;
const headers = { 'apikey': key, 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + key };

// Read bookings
fetch(url + '/rest/v1/bookings?property_id=in.(5,6,7,8)&status=eq.active&select=...', { headers })

// Paginate (Supabase caps at 1000 rows)
fetch(url + '/rest/v1/bookings?...&limit=1000&offset=0', { headers })
```

### PriceLabs MCP (connected in Claude Code)
- Tools: `list_listings`, `get_prices`, `get_portfolio_prices`, `get_listing_settings`, `update_listing_settings`, `get_reservation_data`, `get_market_data`
- PriceLabs API base: `https://api.pricelabs.co/v1`
- Auth header: `X-API-Key: {PRICELABS_API_KEY from settings.json}`

### PriceLabs API patterns (for remote routines)
```
POST /v1/listing_prices
body: { listings: [{ id: "471179", pms: "ownerrez", dateFrom: "YYYY-MM-DD", dateTo: "YYYY-MM-DD" }] }

GET /v1/neighborhood_data?pms=ownerrez&listing_id=471179
→ returns 25th/50th/75th/90th percentile pricing by date

POST /v1/listings
body: { listings: [{ id: "471179", pms: "ownerrez", min: 105, base: 228 }] }
→ update pricing settings
```

### OwnerRez MCP (connected in Claude Code)
- Tools: `get_properties`, `get_bookings`, `get_booking_detail`, `get_guests`, `get_revenue_summary`
- Note: LOCAL only — not available to remote CoWork routines. Use Supabase for booking data in routines.

### Owner Portal
- Repo: `github.com/pictureperfectstays/picture-perfect-stays-portal` (private)
- Deployed on Vercel, reads from Supabase
- Local clone: `C:\Users\crhan\Projects\picture-perfect-stays-portal`

## Revenue Management Philosophy
- **Never price blind** — always check market percentile data before recommending price changes
- **Gap nights** — proactively offer discounted nights between bookings to adjacent guests
- **Market position** — Emerald Views targets 75th–90th percentile (premium 1BR with 2BA)
- **Scottsdale summer** — needs aggressive min stays and extended stay discounts
- **Cancellation pattern** — Emerald Views has high cancellation rate, watch closely

---

## Key Revenue Questions I ask regularly
- What are my open nights in the next 30/60/90 days and how are they priced vs market?
- What is my booking window for [property] this year vs last year?
- Which properties have gap nights that need outreach?
- How does my ADR compare to market percentiles for [property]?
- What is my cancellation rate for [property] this year?
- Which booking channel produces the highest ADR?
- Should I raise, lower, or hold prices for [property] over [date range]?

## GitHub repos
- Owner Portal: `github.com/pictureperfectstays/picture-perfect-stays-portal` (private)
- Revenue Estimator: `github.com/pictureperfectstays/pictureperfectstays-revenue` (private)
- Automation scripts: `github.com/pictureperfectstays/pps-automation` (**public** — daily report, future automation)

---

## Channel Markups & Fees (critical for gap discount math)
- **Airbnb:** 18.34% markup in OwnerRez, 15.5% host-only fee → net ≈ PriceLabs price (cancel out by design)
- **VRBO:** 10% markup, 8% fee (5% VRBO + 3% payment processing)
- **Booking.com:** 30% markup, 18% fee
- **Direct:** 0% markup, 0% fee
- Gap discount base = OwnerRez `charges_json` rent / nights (= PriceLabs net target, markup not in charges_json)
- Gap discount formula: discounted_rent = base × (1 - pct), guest_pays = discounted_rent × (1 + tax_rate), your_net = discounted_rent × (1 - channel_fee)

## Tax Rates (in Supabase `tax_rules` table, loaded at runtime)
- Panama City Beach, FL (Prop 5): 13% total (Bay County 5% + PCB 1% + FL State 7%)
- Sevierville, TN (Prop 6): 12.75% total (Sevier County 3% + TN State 9.75%)
- Scottsdale, AZ (Props 7 & 8): 13.97% total (Maricopa County 7.27% + City Hotel/Motel 5% + City Hotels 1.70%)
- Note: FL state 7% is remitted by Airbnb directly; OwnerRez only tracks 6% for PCB

## PriceLabs API Key
- In `~/.claude/settings.json` as `PRICELABS_API_KEY`
- Also in `C:\Users\crhan\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (used by MCP)
- Note: PriceLabs returns `LISTING_NO_DATA` during overnight recalculation (~11pm–6am AZ). Normal at 7am send time.

## What's built vs planned
**Built:**
- Supabase schema + booking sync (every 3 hours)
- Owner Portal (Vercel, reads Supabase, tax reporting from `tax_rules` table)
- PriceLabs + OwnerRez MCPs
- `tax_rules` table populated for all 3 markets
- **Daily revenue email report (Phase 1 COMPLETE)** — `daily-report/index.js`
  - Sends from `reports@mail.staypictureperfect.com` via Resend
  - Sections: MTD revenue YoY, 24h activity, open nights + gap discount tables, PriceLabs pricing
  - Logo + Instagram icon hosted on Supabase Storage (`assets` bucket)
  - Scheduling: GitHub Actions is the agreed approach (not yet configured — next session)
- **Pricing Alerts section (COMPLETE)** — proactive RED/YELLOW per property × 3 windows
  - Uses `price` field only (final channel price, not user_price/uncustomized_price)
  - Neighborhood data category = bedroom count key; Y_values for Occ is double-nested (Y_values[0][0])
  - 61-90 day market occ intentionally null (advance-booking bias makes it unreliable)
  - Actions are directive: "Reduce prices in PriceLabs..." not "Monitor..."

**Phase 2 — in progress:**
- **Booking Pace vs Last Year (NEXT)** — spec agreed, ready to build next session
  - Use `booked_at` NOT `created_at` (created_at is Supabase insert date, useless for pace)
  - Prorate revenue across month boundaries by nights
  - Include current month if >= 7 days remain; otherwise show next 3 full months
  - Status = 'active', revenue field = gross_revenue
- Revenue forecast (projected month-end based on pace + historical fill rates)
- Smart event detection (Cardinals games, spring break, foliage) calibrated to actual historical ADR

**Also planned:** GitHub Actions daily schedule, seasonal price floor automation, Owner Portal auth upgrade (magic link), Invoice/Stripe, Revenue estimator, Client onboarding
